#MiniAdventure

MiniAdventure is an engine for making first person RPGs on the Pebble watch. It started as an extension of MiniDungeon, but almost all of the code has been replaced at this point. The engine is data driven, which will allow people with limited programming knowledge the ability to create their own stories and put them up on the Pebble app store. The data processing requires python, but one should be able to get by without a full SDK install. I will be adding full instructions to the wiki here as I lock down all of the steps.
