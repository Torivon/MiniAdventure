#MiniAdventure

This is an extension of MiniDungeon (https://github.com/Torivon/MiniDungeon). It started from the same core engine to support a broader game. 

The game is broken up into stories. From the title screen you can choose which story to explore. At the moment, each story has its own locations, monsters, character classes, and skills.
