MiniAdventure
===========

This is an extension of MiniDungeon. It uses the same core engine to support a broader game. Eventual goals include a more complicated battle system, a larger game world, and the ability to support a rudimentary story.

MiniDungeon
===========

Explore a dungeon as you go about your day. Exploring is randomized and time based, so you only act when an event is triggered. Encounter random monsters and chests. Survive, and you can advance deeper into the dungeon. 

Controls:
Use the up, down, and select buttons to activate the menu options on the right of the screen. The back button will exit sub-menus, and exit the app when you are at the main adventure screen. If you are in battle and need to exit in a hurry, holding the back button will force exit the game. 

Features:
* Support for Pebble, Pebble Time, and Pebble Time Round.
* Automatically saves progress on exiting, including the state of combat in the case of a force exit.
* Optional vibration when an event happens.
* Optional fast mode to speed up events. It does not change the relative frequency of event types, but makes the game faster if you have some dedicated play time.
* Optional background app to explore while you use other apps and watchfaces. The background app can interrupt you when an event happens or save it for the next time you want to play.
